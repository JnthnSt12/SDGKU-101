            <p><strong>American Airlines</strong>. Their merger with US Airways created an overlap in technology and programs. They knew spreadsheets were insufficient for managing resources and complex projects. To gain visibility into the broader divisional and global priorities, they began using portfolio and resource management for time entry, resource management, and capacity planning. As a result, the airline went from capitalizing 10 percent of their IT labor to 20 percent, which equated to a multi-million-dollar net positive impact on their balance sheet. Now, they have access to better, more reliable data to make critical decisions on projects and resources.</p>

        <p><strong>The Royal Bank of Scotland</strong>. They needed to establish consistent, reliable data to inform financial and resource decisions. They chose portfolio and resource management to drive consistency as they decommissioned 35 legacy systems, 50+ user-developed tools, and hundreds of spreadsheets. With data in different formats and hundreds of projects managed by different systems, they wanted to get a grip on their data to see their total portfolio more clearly. They could deliver on their business case and achieve ROI within 12 months. Along the way, theyâ€™ve improved transparency and reduced costs in each business unit.</p>

        <p><strong>Cengage Learning</strong>. They were unable to forecast capacity effectively. Managing projects and resources with spreadsheets was creating  complexity for the medical and education publishing company. They wanted to integrate the planning and execution stages of product delivery. They chose portfolio and resource management investment and capacity planning to show executives all the great work they could tackle if they just had the sufficient resources. Now, they can prioritize and push projects down the timeline and more easily identify which groups need new hires.</p>
