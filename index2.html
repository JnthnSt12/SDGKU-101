    <h2 class="bio">Bio</h2>
    <p class="bioinput">I am a 29-year-old male currently serving in the military. I grew up in Long Beach, CA and I have many siblings. My favorite subject in school was math. My current job field is in engineering. I had a part-time job before I joined the military. I have come to realize that I enjoy learning how to code. Additionally, I would like to keep my information as private as possible since you never know who is watching this. I hope that is okay.

    <p class="educationinput">I graduated from Long Beach High School in 2009. I did not start working towards my degree until 7 years later. I graduated from a college with associate's degree last year. My area of study was in supervision and management. Currently working on enrolling for a B.S. in Interdisciplinary Studies with Liberty University Online. Also, I am learning to code with the San Diego Global Knowledge University via the Full Stack Development Immersive course!</p>
