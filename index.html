    <h2> Bio</h2>
    <p class="bio-text">I am a 29-year-old male currently serving in the military. I grew up in Long Beach, CA and I have many siblings. My favorite subject in school is mathematics! I joined the military almost right out of high school and my current job field is in ENGINEERING. I had a part-time job while I was in high school and before I joined the military. I have recently discovered that I am interested in learning how to code. In my research of learning how to code, I came across a forum discussion regarding the <strong>Full Stack Development Immersion</strong> program offered at San Diego Global Knowlege University and there was many positive comments about the program. So after doing some investigating, I decided to <em>bandwagon with the team</em> and am now learning how to code! I also plan to acquire a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science once I am out of the military by using the Post 9/11 Forever GI Bill.
